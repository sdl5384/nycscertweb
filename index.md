Hello, my name is Sam Lojacono and welcome to my *nycscertweb* page.  In this website I have posted a series of projects I have completed not only during my time as a graduate student through Hunter's College Computer Science Ed program, but my own ongoing projects.

I first got into coding when I was still an undegrad at college.  I had to take a Java programming course as part of my degree.  I enjoyed it as soon as we started.

I soon began to develop as a coding hobbyist. I first started getting involved with Java and independely learning the different facets of Java I did not learn earlier in class.

**Computer Science Education Coursework**

|Course Name                             | Filename         | Description|
|----------------------------------------|:----------------:|-----------|
|Programming in a higher level language  | SuperArray.java  | We learned how to create our own custom SuperArray class to make data storage more dynamic.|
|Programming in a higher level language  | Rationals.java   | Used OOP to simulate a rudimentary class of rational numbers in Java language.|
|Programming in a higher level language  | CGOL.java        | Java program to simulate and run Conway's automaton Game of life.|
|Data Structures                         | ArrayList.java   | Created our own library of ArrayLists, a dynamic way of add, storing, and deleting data in Java.|
|Data Structures                         | LinkedList.java  | Create a library that generates a given number of Nodes|
|Data Structures                         | SortSearch.java  | Create a library of searching and sorting algorithms|
|Data Structures                         | SortSearchReferenceDriver.java| Program that test and calculates how much time each sorting algorithm takes to finish.|
|Data Strucutres                         | TreeDriver.java and ExpressionTree.java| Program that traverses an expression tree and performs calculations based on the nature of the tree itself.

**Computer Science Methods Coursework Assignments**
|Course Name                            | Description of Activity          | Associated Filename (if any)|
|---------------------------------------|:-----------------:|------------|
|Driver and Navigator Activity | This activity was to demonstrate how teachers can use student pairs in order to work together to either direct what they need to do while coding| TBD |

**Other projects I have worked on so far.**
I work and code in other languages as well, such as Microsoft VBA and Python.  As of right now I am developing and evolving a script in Python that collects and records data from radio station websites.  This project was developed to not only analyze how songs are frequently played on the air, but to attempt to identify at musical preferences as well.

I am also working independently on projects related to Raspberry Pi and Arduino.  One project I am working on in particular is with implementing Raspberry Pi to automating one of my telescopes.  The goal of this project is to automate one of my non-electronic telescopes so that all I need to do is hitting a few buttons on the computer and it will direct the computer where to go to where I want to observe.
